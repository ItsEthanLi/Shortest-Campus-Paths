This gives users the shortest path between two locations on the UW Seattle campus using Dijkstra's algorithim.
To use: copy and paste server and client folders into https://download-directory.github.io/ to download. Navigate to where the folder is stored in git bash, and type npm run start. 
Then go to https://http://localhost:8080. Select two buildings and the path generated from Dijkstra's algorithim will be automatically generated.
